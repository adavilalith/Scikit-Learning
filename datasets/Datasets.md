# Datasets

This folder contains references to the datasets used in this project. Please note that the datasets themselves are **not** included in the repository and must be downloaded separately.

## 1. Mushroom Classification Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Mushroom Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification)
- **Description**: This dataset includes 22 attributes to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous. It's a great dataset for binary classification problems and involves categorical features such as cap shape, color, and habitat.
- **Usage**: The dataset is used in this project for building a machine learning model to predict whether a mushroom is safe to eat or not.
- **Format**: CSV file

## 2. Iris Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Iris](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)
- **Description**: This is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning and includes 150 observations of iris flowers with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). The task is to classify the flowers into one of three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, or Iris-virginica.
- **Usage**: The dataset is used to demonstrate multi-class classification models in this project.
- **Format**: CSV file
